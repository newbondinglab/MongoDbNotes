use <db name> command activates db(if db doesn't exist then new db is created and activated automatically)

$ mongo
MongoDB shell version v4.0.3
connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
Implicit session: session { "id" : UUID("13f8507e-9b32-4774-afa5-f2e50cc32f7f") }
MongoDB server version: 4.0.3
> use shop
switched to db shop

use db.products.insertOne({...}) command to insert json object in products collection
if products collection doesn't exist then it will be created automatically and json
object will be inserted in that collection

Quotations around key name can be dropped though key will be stored with quotation mark
in db. Values can be string, number, null, boolean, etc..

> db.products.insertOne({name: "Immortals of Mehula", price: 400})

this command will insert the document into the collection with name and price
db refers to shop automatically as shop is the active db right now

If document insertion is successfull then you should see

{
        "acknowledged" : true,
        "insertedId" : ObjectId("5bc8caf8527a23bf58caa212")
}

This confirms document/data is inserted and mongodb automatically assigns a unique id to the document
which returns it back to you

db.products.find()
If you pass no arguments to find method then it will give all the arguments that are present
in that collection

> db.products.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5bc8cad3527a23bf58caa211"), "name" : "sam", "age" : 29 }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5bc8caf8527a23bf58caa212"), "name" : "Immortals", "price" : 400 }

Quotations around key are present as this is a json and for a valid json, keys must be surrounded by quotations
We don't have to use quotations around key at the time of sending key because we can then in that
case pass JavaScript objects directly to mongodb apis without any need to convert them to json
mongodb will do json conversion internally

db.products.find().pretty()
will output json in nice pretty format


db.products.find().pretty()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5bc8cad3527a23bf58caa211"), "name" : "sam", "age" : 29 }
{
        "_id" : ObjectId("5bc8caf8527a23bf58caa212"),
        "name" : "Immortals",
        "price" : 400
}


Doubt: Why pretty is showing not showing first entry in pretty format???
